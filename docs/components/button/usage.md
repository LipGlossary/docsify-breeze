# Button

#> Buttons perform a single, clearly communicated action.

## When and Where To Use

- Buttons are primarily used for action items in forms, widgets and
  modals, or to highlight the most important actions on a screen.
- Buttons come in a primary and a secondary style type. Use these style types to
  prioritize the importance of the actions on screen. When displaying both types
  adjacent to one another, listing the primary action last improves the flow,
  because the conversation "ends" with its conclusion and most important action.

## Writing

- Button text **should never wrap** and should be adjusted to fit within the
  allowed width.
- Labels should strive to be three words or less, using a maximum of 20
  characters.
- Avoid generic phrases like "Click here" and "Go." Instead, use a descriptive
  verb and noun (e.g., "Find a Deal") to give visibility on the resulting end.
